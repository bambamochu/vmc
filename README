Voice model creator for CMU Sphinx
===============================================================================

This tool contains basic tools for creating a custom domain voice model for use
with the PocketSphinx decoder.  It is also possible to use the voice models
created by this tool as the basis for a test-to-speech engine.  

Note this tool has only been tested with Linux Mint 17.3 & 18.

**Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.**

Linux/Unix installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

vmc is generally run from within its top-level folder, and the voice model it 
creates is generated within that folder. i.e.:

    $ ~/vmc
    $ ~/vmc/new-voice-model

two of the vmc dependencies, sphinxbase and sphinxtrain, are compiled in a 
location of the user's choice.  To install the vmc dependencies with the 
provided script, this location must be provided.  It is assumed that the
location is a direct subdirectory of the user's home directory:

    $ mkdir ~/tools

To install vmc's dependencies, run:

    example: $ sudo bash install.sh [install location]

    $ sudo bash install.sh tools

For example, full installation on an AMD64 computer running Mint 18 would look 
like this:

    $ cd ~/
    $ git clone https://github.com/umhau/vmc.git
    $ mkdir tools
    $ cd vmc
    $ sudo bash install.sh tools

See use examples in the next section.

Usage instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tools brings together a number of disparate data files that are needed for 
creating a voice model.  This graph illustrates the logic involved:

                   word domain
                        +
                        |
                        v
        +-------+ sentence list+----------+
        |               +                 |
        |               |                 |
        v               v                 v
    dictionary      grammar: LM    voice samples
        +               +                 +
        |               |                 |
        |               v                 |
        +--------> voice model <----------+
                    training
                        +
                        |
                        v
                   voice model

Each of these steps, starting with the sentence list (given) and ending with the 
voice model are contained within this tool.

To use vmc, it is necessary to provide a few perameters.  These are:

    - the model name
    - the file containing the sentence list
    - an integer called 'voice training iterations' (VTI)

The tool requests recordings of each sentence provided in the file.  The user is 
able to specify the number of times each sentence is used is making recordings 
with the input perameter 'voice training iterations'.  If the value is 0, no 
voice samples will be requested, and the tool will to as much as it can without 
them.  Note for brevity's sake the variable is abbreviated VTI.

Example usage:

    $ cd ~/vmc
    $ sudo bash vmc.sh new-voice-model ../Downloads/sentence-list.txt 2

Note that dependencies are not checked when running vmc.sh.  To check 
dependencies, see the section above. 

If VTI is > 0, the user will be prompted to read each entry in the 
sentence list.  

The output of the command will be found at:

    $ ~/vmc/new-voice-model

This folder will contain all necessary files to run PocketSphinx with a custom
voice model.


Non-association
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool was not created in conjunction with the CMU Sphinx developers.
