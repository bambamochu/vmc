# DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------------------------------------
# 
#       Creates a number of text files dependent on a sentence file which are 
#       required for building a CMU Sphinx voice model.  Also uses the extended
#       PocketSphinx pronunciation dictionary.
# 
#       Note that the target directory is the directory where the files should 
#       be saved into. This should be similar to the directory the initial 
#       command was given from within.
#
#       The last two options in the usage example are optional. The 'number of 
#       preexisting audio recordings' variable is used for adding to an 
#       existing collection of audio recordings - it controls how the new 
#       .wav files are named (starting from zero, or something higher).  The 
#       last one, 'the fancy sentence list', is only looked for if the other is
#       present.  It is the absolute path of the sentence list that vmc edited
#       the last time it was creating audio files in the given folder.  Instead
#       of starting from scratch, vmc can simply append the new items into that 
#       list.  
#
#       The integration of the new functions should be seamless, though I 
#       anticipate that it will be a royal pain to get it working.
# 
# USAGE | EXAMPLE--------------------------------------------------------------
# 
#       python3 format_text.py /path/to/sentence-file.txt \
#                              model-name \
#                              audio_folder \
#                              iterations \ 
#                              num_of_preexisting_audio_recordings 
# 
# FILES CREATED ---------------------------------------------------------------
#       All are marked for new information to be appended. Therefore, I don't
#       have to provide the old names of any files - just make sure the model
#       names are the same.  Since none of these come with a model name except
#       the .dict file (.dic??), I should be fine with the current 
#       configuration.
