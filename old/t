# USAGE
# 
#       add the options thing to vmc, then copy vmc to somewhere on the system path. That way I can
#       call it as a system command when needed.  It will have everything it needs right here.
# 
#       the vmc package will be copied to /opt, where all such 3rd party tool packages are saved.
# 
# 
# INSTALLATION
# 
#       vmc created in /opt
#       tools & functions copied into vmc
#       vmc (shell script) is moved to /usr/local/bin
#

# For example, someapp would be installed in /opt/someapp, with one of its command being 
# /opt/someapp/bin/foo, its configuration file would be in /etc/opt/someapp/foo.conf, and its log 
# files in /var/opt/someapp/logs/foo.access.
